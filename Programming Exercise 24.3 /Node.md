## Implementing a Doubly Linked List:
Implementing a doubly linked list in Java involves defining a Node class and a DoublyLinkedList class.

**1. Node Structure Each node has:**

- Data (the value it holds)
- Reference to the next node
- Reference to the previous node

**2. DoublyLinkedList Class This class manages:**

- The head (first node)
- The tail (last node)
- Methods for insertion, deletion, and traversal

**Example Node Class:**

      class Node<T> {
          T data;
          Node<T> next;
          Node<T> prev;
      
          public Node(T data) {
              this.data = data;
              this.next = null;
              this.prev = null;
          }
      }

**3. Common operations to implement:**

**Insertion:**
- addAtHead(T data): Adds a new node at the beginning of the list.
- addAtTail(T data): Adds a new node at the end of the list.
- addAtIndex(int index, T data): Adds a new node at a specific index.

**Deletion:**
- deleteAtHead(): Removes the node at the beginning.
- deleteAtTail(): Removes the node at the end.
- deleteAtIndex(int index): Removes the node at a specific index.

**Traversal:**
- printForward(): Iterates and prints elements from head to tail.
- printBackward(): Iterates and prints elements from tail to head.

**Other utilities:**
- get(int index): Retrieves the data at a specific index.
- isEmpty(): Checks if the list is empty.
- size(): Returns the number of elements.

## Summary:
The key to implementing a doubly linked list lies in correctly managing the next and prev pointers during insertion and deletion operations to maintain the integrity of the list. Always test your list with various operations and edge cases, especially for removing nodes at the ends and from the middle.
